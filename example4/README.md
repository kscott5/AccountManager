Account Manager
==============	
Example 4 of 9


Simple self-contain web application to learn 
KnockoutJS, RequireJS, text and toastr javascript 
frameworks. 

> In the previous examples, I did the following:

1) Correct configuration of the requireJS framework 
2) Embed template base html pages in  main application
   page - home.html, using requireJS text plugin
3) Include toastr framework for log
4) Stub basic main application page - home.html
5) Continous refactoring for code reuse and maintenace

Be agile and remember we can refactor as you go! This
is easies said than done. Especially when you don't have
help or internet connect, and your constantly reviewing
the library's code and printed documentation for correct 
use.

> Here's what to expect from this example:

1) Use hash name or #name for basic navigation
   Ex: http://localhost:94/home.html#mail
	  document.location.hash
   This didn't happen in example 3 but that's 
   where agile's - prioritization and recalibration
   come in handy.
2) Basic form submission: login. This will change
   if and when I include third party API access
   using OAuth to authenticate and authorize
3) Basic style, again ambious for single individual.
4) Basic interaction with Windows Live API. After all
   the point to starting all this was to manage
   multiple online accounts. This is ambious considering
   the level of detail I include throughout these 
   example to help the next developer. But its a goal!

NOTE: Some of this will be ambious for a individual
	  and some pieces I just won't have time to get to.
	  But on a team that incldues some of these roles:

		client stakeholder
		project manager
		business analyst
		user experience designer
		developers
		architects
		quality assurance
		end users

   There are many possiblities!
