		*****************************************************<br/>
		*   Simple self-contain web application to learn <br/>
		*	KnockoutJS, RequireJS, text and toastr javascript <br/>
		*	frameworks. <br/>
		*<br/>
		* 	In the previous examples, I did the following:<br/>
		*<br/>
		*	1) Correct configuration of the requireJS framework <br/>
		*	2) Embed template base html pages in  main application<br/>
		*	   page - home.html, using requireJS text plugin<br/>
		*	3) Include toastr framework for log<br/>
		*   4) Stub basic main application page - home.html<br/>
		*	5) Continous refactoring for code reuse and maintenace<br/>
		*<br/>
		*	Be agile and remember we can refactor as you go! This<br/>
		*   is easies said than done. Especially when you don't have<br/>
		*	help or internet connect, and your constantly reviewing<br/>
		*	the library's code and printed documentation for correct <br/>
		*	use.<br/>
		*<br/>
		*	Here's what to expect from this example:<br/>
		*<br/>
		*	1) Use hash name or #name for basic navigation<br/>
		*	   Ex: http://localhost:94/home.html#mail<br/>
		*          document.location.hash<br/>
		*	   This didn't happen in example 3 but that's <br/>
		*	   where agile's - prioritization and recalibration<br/>
		*	   come in handy.<br/>
		*	2) Basic form submission: login. This will change<br/>
		*	   if and when I include third party API access<br/>
		*	   using OAuth to authenticate and authorize<br/>
		*	3) Basic style, again ambious for single individual.<br/>
		*	4) Basic interaction with Windows Live API. After all<br/>
		*	   the point to starting all this was to manage<br/>
		*	   multiple online accounts. This is ambious considering<br/>
		*	   the level of detail I include throughout these <br/>
		*	   example to help the next developer. But its a goal!<br/>
		*<br/>
		*	NOTE: Some of this will be ambious for a individual<br/>
		*	      and some pieces I just won't have time to get to.<br/>
		*	      But on a team that incldues some of these roles:<br/>
		*<br/>
		*			client stakeholder<br/>
		*			project manager<br/>
		*			business analyst<br/>
		*			user experience designer<br/>
		*			developers<br/>
		*			architects<br/>
		*			quality assurance<br/>
		*			end users<br/>
		*<br/>
		*	   There are many possiblities!<br/>
