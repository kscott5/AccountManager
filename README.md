==============

A tutorial that explorers a minimal or simple use of standard HTML, [Javascript](http://developer.mozilla.org) and [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org).

This tutorial is a series of [git checkouts](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout), [git commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit), 
[git merge](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) and [git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) on this repository, and

1. Introduces basic project structure without initial node_modules depends.
2. Gradually makes changes of code with different javascript recommendations or requirements. 
3. Uses open source or free OS, frameworks, libraries and tools for programming.
4. Slow introduction and use of Nodejs http and net.Socket modules.
5. Slow migration towards simple webserver with CORS and oauth2 integraion.
6. Make a small telnet functional database or data store with [redis](https://redis.io) client, and more.

Discover the use of [git revert](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert) [git stash](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash) helps.

No worries about the [Microsoft Graph API](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer) application client_id. Its included in
with every [git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push), and secure with [Microsoft Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), 
Google API, and other similar portal application registration page.

NOTE: At the time of creating this, I didn't have home internet access and Chicago public library computers stops 
administrative access on command prompt and executable files. All tools are open source, free downloads with simple
terms of use. Share details.

Its possibly faster with existing third party software or hardward library; however, each uses its own opinion relative with industry standards
around javascript, html and css. Specifically knockout, angular, reactjs, vuejs and others.

Today's computer configuration is a HP ElitBook with [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/), a Debian linux os distrution. There's a 
Windows 10 Desktop but that's not portable.
