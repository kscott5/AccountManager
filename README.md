Simple tutorial to learn Object Oriented Javascript, KnockoutJS, RequireJS, Windows Live API and more

This tutorial is spread across several examples that provide the following details:

1. Introduction and basic project structure
2. Basic refactor of javascript code to conform with object oriented best practices
3. Utilize open source or free tools for development primarily Nginx web server
4. Slow introduce the various javascript script libraries
5. Begin introduction of Windows Live API
6. Replacement of Nginx web server with Ruby on Rails
7. Document lesson learn as I go along.
8. Version control

No worries about the Windows Live API client_id and client_secret. I know it was included in
my initial push but I hope you DO THE RIGHT THING until I remove this. It would be much 
appreciated if you do no harm. 

If I have time I will uses Rails yaml or something like rails can detect as configuration 
to store this data. Then exclude that file using the .gitignore.

NOTE: At the time of creating this, I didn't have internet access and or a computer with
administrative access. So when I complete the this tutorial I will include the contents of 
my USB drive I created to complete ALL this work. It contains all the tools I needed to work 
from a public computer with internet access, namely at the local public library.
