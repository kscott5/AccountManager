Account Manager
==============	
Example 8 of 9

*****************************************************
*   Simple self-contain web application to learn 
*	KnockoutJS, RequireJS, text and toastr javascript 
*	frameworks. 
*
* 	In the previous examples, I did the following:
*
*	1) Refactoring of the code to better understand Rails
*	2) Review additional Rails gems to help shortcut work
*      Don't reinvent the wheel if you don't have to
*   3) Review Windows Live API and code to determine
*      mismatch
*
*   Here's what to expect in this example:
*
*   1) Windows Live API calls for session, me and
*      onedrive access
*   2) Application logging and configuration
*   3) Knockout binding of folders, files, etc
