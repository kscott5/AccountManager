Account Manager
==============	
Example 5 of 9

*****************************************************
*   Simple self-contain web application to learn 
*	KnockoutJS, RequireJS, text and toastr javascript 
*	frameworks. 
*
* 	In the previous examples, I did the following:
*
*	1) Correct configuration of the requireJS framework 
*	2) Refactoring and folder restructuring
*	3) Basic navigation using hash - #hash
*   4) Basic styling (css)
*
*	Here's what to expect from this example:
*
*	1) Basic interaction with Windows Live API. After all
*	   the point to starting all this was to manage
*	   multiple online accounts. This is ambious considering
*	   the level of detail I include throughout these 
*	   example to help the next developer. But its a goal!
	   There are many possiblities!
