Example 11 - Outlook IMAP API integration


Simple self-contain web application to learn 
KnockoutJS, RequireJS, text and toastr javascript 
frameworks.

Well, it evolved into a more complex application
as should any project over a few iteration. 

> In the previous examples, I did the following:

1) Switch between Windows and Google API
2) Login and Logout using Google API
3) Display Google API basic profile information
4) Access Google Drive (top or root folder container)

> Here's what to expect from this example:

1) Promise object 
2) Outlook IMAP integration
3) Prefilter on REST service (authenticated user)
;-)
