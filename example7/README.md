Example 7 of 9


Simple self-contain web application to learn 
KnockoutJS, RequireJS, text and toastr javascript 
frameworks. 

> In the previous examples, I did the following:

1) Replaced Nginx server with WEBrick. This was a major
   undertaken considering installing and configuring
   the Ruby and Rails environment. This had to be done
   to allow for Windows Live API to POST back to our
   callback page.
 2) Intergation of existing javascript libraries into
	Rails convention
3) Syntax changes required for Rails (aka HtmlHelper)

> Here's what to expect in this example:

1) Refactoring of the code to better understand Rails
2) Review additional Rails gems to help shortcut work
  Don't reinvent the wheel if you don't have to
3) Review Windows Live API and code to determine
  mismatch
