Account Manager
==============	
Example 3 of 9


Simple self-contain web application to learn 
KnockoutJS, RequireJS and other javascript 
frameworks. 

> In the previous examples, I did the following:
I learned basically how to work with the various javascript libraries, namely
KnockoutJS and RequireJS. Plus provide some overall structure or architecture 
to the application. This important because it helps minimize maintenance and
improves our ability to add feature later.  

Be agile and remember we can refactor as you go!

> Here's what to expect from this example:

1) introduction to application logging using toastjs
2) add knockout dependency to the manager library
3) remove knockout dependency from viewmodels library
4) load header, footer and navigation  html pages. Using requireJS and text library.
5) Use hash name or #name for navigation. Use convention so name should match html page.
5) basic interaction with Windows Live API. After all the point to starting all this was to manage multiple online accounts. (MAYBE - NOT SURE YET)
