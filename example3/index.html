	<p>
		*****************************************************
		*   Simple self-contain web application to learn 
		*	KnockoutJS, RequireJS and other javascript 
		*	frameworks. 
		*
		* 	In the previous examples, I learned basically how
		*   to work with the various javascript libraries, namely
		*	KnockoutJS and RequireJS. Plus provide some overrall 
		*   structure or architecture to the application. This 
		*	important because it helps minimize maintenance and
		*   improves our ability to add feature later.  
		*
		*	Be agile and remember we can refactor as you go!
		*
		*	Here's what to expect from this example:
		*
		*	1) introduction to application logging using toastjs
		*	2) add knockout dependency to the manager library
		*	3) remove knockout dependency from viewmodels library
		*	4) load header, footer and navigation  html pages. Using
		*	   requireJS and text library.
		*	5) Use hash name or #name for navigation.
		*      Use convention so name should match html page.
		*   5) basic interaction with Windows Live API. After all
		*	   the point to starting all this was to manage
		*	   multiple online accounts. (MAYBE - NOT SURE YET)
