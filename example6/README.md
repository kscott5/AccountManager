Account Manager
==============	
Example 6 of 9


Simple self-contain web application to learn 
KnockoutJS, RequireJS, text and toastr javascript 
frameworks. 

> In the previous examples, I did the following:

1) Basic interaction with Windows Live API. After all
   the point to starting all this was to manage
   multiple online accounts. This is ambious considering
   the level of detail I include throughout these 
   example to help the next developer. But its a goal!
   There are many possibilities!

> Here's what to expect from this example:

1) Replaced Nginx server with WEBrick. This was a major
   undertaken considering installing and configuring
   the Ruby and Rails environment. This had to be done
   to allow for Windows Live API to POST back to our
   callback page.
 2) Intergation of existing javascript libraries into
	Rails convention
3) Syntax changes required for Rails (aka HtmlHelper)
